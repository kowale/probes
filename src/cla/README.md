# Computational linear algebra

Notes from [MATH70024] at Imperial.
I'd like to try a few alternative factorisations
or shortcuts for the algebraic baseline in [iskakov19].
Main drawbacks of learnable DLT are

1. No way to learn full pose priors in 3D
2. No way to ignore badly calibrated views

Drawback (2) can be detected at runtime,
but (1) is indeed problematic.
Is there a way to gain the flexibility
of the volumetric triangulation,
without the explicit fusion of features?
